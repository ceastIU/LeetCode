    "The time complexity of the given code is O(4^(RC)) where R is the number of rows in the board and C is the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, each cell could be a potential starting point for the word search, and at each cell, you explore up to 4 directions (up, down, left, right). For each starting cell, you explore the word of length len(word) through DFS.\n",

    "Since the depth of the recursion is bounded by the length of the word, the space complexity can also be considered O(len(word)), even though you're using additional space for the directions list and the visited cells set (in your original code), as well as some constant space for variables."
