    "The time complexity of the given code is O(4^(RC)) where R is the number of rows in the board and C is the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, each cell could be a potential starting point for the word search, and at each cell, you explore up to 4 directions (up, down, left, right). For each starting cell, you explore the word of length len(word) through DFS.\n",
