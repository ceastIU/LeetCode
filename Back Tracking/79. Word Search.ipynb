    "This was a really fun problem, and I had the correct idea, I just needed a different approach to keeping track of the path we had traversed. Originally I was marking cells as 0 when visited because we didn't want to reuse cells we had already visited. However, at first this failed because it was making permenant changes to the board. Therefore I had to change it to a deep copy. This appraoch sorta of worked, but I realized I need to create an even deeper copy to then pass futher down to the recursion. This idea mostly worked, but failed to execute within the allotated time.\n",
