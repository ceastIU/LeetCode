    "This was by far the hardest problem I have faced thus far in the backtracking section of LeetCode. I couldn't come up with either the known length of each side or the 4 sides approach to the problem. This is a problem that I was original able to partially solve with a far different and incorrect approach. I needed so much help to know the proper way to tackle the problem. And even then, I was doing a lot of etra work that I didn't need to do. In the end, the problem itself is tricky but once you understand the core ideas of the problem it becomes easy to code. \n",
