Because as I learned the first time I attempted this problem: we can not just do a level order traversal, we can choose to pick a node twice in a row.\n"

    "This is a fun problem, but I needed a ton of extra help solving the problem by refreshing my memory of the exact way the problem was solved. This isn't great review as I didn't remember how to solve it on my own. I'm guess the time complexity is the height of the tree. I was wrong, the time comlexity is O(n). As we have to visit every node once."
