- n choose k = O |           n!         |  
                 |     (k! * (n - k)!)) |

- backtracking combinations of size n = O(n*2^n)

- permutations is O(n!) 

- word search:  O(N * 4^L) Where N is the number of cells, l is the length of the word, and the 4 is the number of directions we are searching.
                O(L) space complexity, where l is the path we are keeping track of

- IP address:   O(1) more specifically 3^4
                O(1) limited number of combinations means that there is no way to grow any single piece of memory

- Flood Fill:   O(m*n) where m is rows and n is cols
                O(N) where n is the number of cells/pixels

- Phone number: O(3^m * 4^n) m is the number of digits that map to 3 chars, and n is the number of digits that map to 4 chars
                0(N) where N is the number of digits, this is related to the recusive stack
