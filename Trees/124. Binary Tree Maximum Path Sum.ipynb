    "A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.\n",

    "- The key observation is this idea of \"splitting.\" Since the path can only go through a node once, we can not return to higher level parent nodes once a split has occured. \n",
    "- Once a node \"splits\" (to left and right subtrees), the path can never return to the parent. It must continue along that path. \n",
    "- So recursively, we determine to things:\n",
    "    1. What is the max value we achieve if we decide to split at that node? (node.val + left + right)\n",
    "    2. What is the max value we pass to the parent node that is NOT a product of splitting? (node.val + max(left,right)) \n",
    "- Base case is not root: return 0\n",
    "- Also going to cheat a bit with a global variable to make the problem easier"
