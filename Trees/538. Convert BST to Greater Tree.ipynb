    "The part where I got tripped up is thinking I had to rebuild the tree. When in actuallity, all I had to do was reassign the values of the nodes. Once I realized I no longer need to build the tree. The problem was far easier. I am proud of myself for realizing that it was a flipped inorder traversal, and my ability to achieve the desired outcome with calculating the values in the right order. Overall a great problem that took a little bit of time to solve!"
