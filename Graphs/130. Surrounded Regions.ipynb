    "- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.\n",

    "- The neetcode way makes a lot of sense, and involves first marking all unsurrounded \"O\"'s with a DFS capture method, then marking all the remaining \"O\"'s with an X then finally remarking the captured \"O\"'s as \"O\"'s\n",

Because currently if a cell is surrounded by 3 x's and a previously visited cell then the algorithm I'm using breaks down. I could probably implement these news data structure changes, but at that point I have something that is a less efficent and elegant solution to what NeetCode presents, so I'm going to scrap my plans and rely on the elegant solution both ChatGPT and NeetCode offered up!\n",
