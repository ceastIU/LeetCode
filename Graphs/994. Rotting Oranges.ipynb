    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "The worst-case time complexity is O(R * C), where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns in the grid. This is because, in the worst case, all the cells may be rotten, and in each iteration of the while loop, you are visiting each rotten cell's neighboring cells.\n",

    "The space complexity is O(R * C) as well. In the worst case, all cells could be rotten, and thus the rotten queue could contain up to R * C elements. Additionally, the variables freshCount, rottenCount, and constants like x, y, xx, yy, newX, newY, etc., occupy constant space.\n",
