    "There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.\n",

    "The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.\n",

    "The first two nested loops that initiate the DFS from the edge cells (i, 0 and i, COLS-1 for rows and 0, i and ROWS-1, i for columns) take O(ROWS + COLS) time, where ROWS is the number of rows and COLS is the number of columns in the grid.\n",
