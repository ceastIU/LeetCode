    "The loop that builds the neighbors list iterates through each prerequisite once, taking O(E) time.\n",

    "Finally, the loop that performs cycle detection iterates through all the vertices (courses) once, taking O(V) time.\n",
    "The space complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (courses) and E is the number of edges (prerequisites).\n",

    "The neighbors list consumes O(V + E) space.\n",
