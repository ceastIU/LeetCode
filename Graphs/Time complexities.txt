Island Perimeter:   O(R*C) r = rows, c = cols, at worst, dfs will visit every cell of the grid
                    0(R*C) r = rows, c = cols, the grid is used to store the visited cells, depending on whether this counts or not since we are reusing memeory given to us

Number of Island:   O(R*C) r = rows, c = cols, at worst, dfs will visit every cell of the grid
                    0(R*C) r = rows, c = cols, the grid is used to store the visited cells, this is the size of the recursive stack

Max Area:           O(ROWS * COLS * avg_island_size)
                    O(ROWS * COLS)

Sub Island:         O(ROWS*COLS) The dfs function is called for each cell in the grid2 (m x n times) during the double loop, and each cell is visited at most once.
                    O(min(m,n)) The primary space used is for recursion, which can go as deep as the dimensions of the grid. The maximum depth of recursion would be min(m, n), which represents the diagonal of the grid.

Flow of water:      O(ROWS * COLS) Since each DFS traversal potentially visits every cell once, the total time complexity of the code is O(ROWS * COLS).
                    O(ROWS * COLS) The pacific and atlantic sets can each store up to O(ROWS * COLS) cells, resulting in a total space complexity of O(ROWS * COLS).

Surrounded:         O(Rows * Cols) This is because the code iterates through each cell in the board exactly once during the three nested loops.
                    O(1) meaning it doesn't use any extra space that scales with the input size.

Reorder Routes:     O(n) each node will be visited once
                    O(n) graph representation (adjacency list) and the recursive call stack during DFS traversal. In the worst case, the recursive call stack could contain all nodes, leading to a space complexity of O(N).

Oranges:            O(R*C) in the worst case, all the cells may be rotten, and in each iteration of the while loop, you are visiting each rotten cell's neighboring cells.
                    O(R*C)  In the worst case, all cells could be rotten, and thus the rotten queue could contain up to R * C elements

Snakes and ladders: O(N*2) The outer while loop iterates until the queue q is empty, which takes O(N^2) time, where N is the number of cells in the board (since it iterates through each cell).
                    O(N*2) The space complexity mainly comes from the usage of the queue q and the set visit, both of which can potentially grow up to O(N^2) in size.

Safe States:        O(N+E) n nodes, e edges
                    O(N) n nodes for the "safe" hashset

Course Schedule:    O(V+E) v vertices, e edges 
                    O(V+E) The neighbors list consumes O(V + E) space.

Shortest Bridge:    O(ROWS*COLS) a product of the dfs and the bfs
                    O(ROWS*COLS) the visit data structure grows to at most rows * cols

Max Dist:           O(ROWS*COLS) a product of the bfs
                    O(ROWS*COLS) the visit data structure grows to at most rows * cols
