    "The function dfs is called for each of the eight possible directions, and for each direction, it can potentially traverse the entire board. In the worst case, it may have to traverse the entire board for each direction. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of dfs is O(ROWS * COLS), where ROWS is the number of rows in the board and COLS is the number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main loop iterates through eight directions, and for each direction, it calls dfs. So, the overall time complexity of your code is O(8 * ROWS * COLS), which can be simplified to O(ROWS * COLS) since constants are dropped in Big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of your code is primarily determined by the recursive calls to the dfs function and the stack frames created during those calls. In the worst case, if the board is large and there is a long sequence of matching colors, you can have a stack of recursive calls, which is limited by the maximum recursion depth in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is O(ROWS * COLS) for the stack space used by the recursive calls. Additionally, there is some constant space used for variables and function parameters. Therefore, the overall space complexity of your code can be considered O(ROWS * COLS).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the time complexity of your code is O(ROWS * COLS), and the space complexity is also O(ROWS * COLS) in the worst case."
