    "You are given two m x n binary matrices grid1 and grid2 containing only 0's (representing water) and 1's (representing land). An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.\n",

    "This was a tricky problem that required a deeper understanding of the \"and\" operator. My initially strategy was largely correct with a few important logical errors. There was little I could have done to solve the technical errors with out that deeper understanding. Overall, still excited about my performance on this problem and my ability to get so close to the answer. There was nothing logically wrong with my approach. My guess for time complexity is that of O(ROWS * COLS * avg size of island in grid2). Space complexity is O(ROWS*COLS) (only when grid2 is not considered given memory).\n",
